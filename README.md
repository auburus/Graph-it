Graph-it

One of the biggest problems of the banking areas are the set of tools designed for obtaining our banking data. With this project, we aim to solve that problem, allowing the end user to view and relate a big set of information, which we obtain from the API, and display it in a graphic form. You maybe want to check how frequently do you retire money? Don't worry, we got that solved for you.
